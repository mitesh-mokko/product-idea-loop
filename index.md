# Product IDEA Loop

**A living system for building and learning faster in the AI era.**

The sprint was built for scarce builders.  
The loop is built for abundant attempts.

## Start here

- Read the manifesto: [README](./README.md)
- Contribute an idea or loop: [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Share artifacts and public updates: [artifacts](./artifacts/README.md)

## What this repo is

This repository is both:

- An open source framework for running IDEA loops
- A public website that evolves with contributions
- A publishing base for loop artifacts, tweets, and learnings

## Core principle

A loop is successful when it improves the starting conditions of the next loop.

There is always another loop tomorrow.
