# Product IDEA Loop

**A living system for building, learning, and shipping faster in the AI era.**

<div class="hero-callout">
The sprint was built for scarce builders.  
The loop is built for abundant attempts.
</div>

## Why this exists

Most teams do not run out of ideas. They run out of affordable attempts.

With AI, building speed is no longer the main bottleneck. Decision quality is.

The IDEA Loop helps teams run focused build-and-learn loops where insight, design, engineering, and analysis happen together in one working session.

## Start here

- Read the full manifesto: [Manifesto](./manifesto/)
- Contribute to the framework with ideas, tools, and techniques: [CONTRIBUTING](./contributing/)
- Share framework evidence, case notes, and public links: [Artifacts](./artifacts/)

## What IDEA means

**IDEA = Insight, Design, Engineering, Analysis**

- **Insight**: what problem are we solving and for whom?
- **Design**: what should the experience feel like?
- **Engineering**: how does it actually work?
- **Analysis**: how will we know it worked?

In IDEA loops, these functions improve each other in real time instead of waiting on long handoffs.

## What a loop is

A loop is one focused round of building and learning.

- Most loops should take a few hours
- Every loop closes within 72 hours
- Each loop ends with:
  1. a concrete output
  2. what was learned
  3. what happens next (ship, iterate, pivot, or stop)

## What this repo is

This repository is both:

- An open source framework for running IDEA loops
- A public website that evolves with contributions
- A publishing base for framework evidence, case notes, and learnings

## Guardrails

- Use sandbox first for exploration
- Apply extra review for high-risk changes
- Do not ship what you cannot explain
- Do not measure value only by hours or ticket count

## Core principle

A loop is successful when it improves the starting conditions of the next loop.  
There is always another loop tomorrow.
