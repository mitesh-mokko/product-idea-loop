# Contributing to Product IDEA Loop

This repository is for improving the IDEA Loop framework itself.
Contributions from PMs, designers, engineers, founders, researchers, and non-coders are welcome.

## What to contribute

Contribute ideas, tools, and techniques that strengthen how IDEA loops are run:

- Better loop planning methods and prompts
- Templates for goals, assumptions, decisions, and outcomes
- Guardrails for quality, safety, privacy, and compliance
- Measurement approaches (signals, scorecards, dashboards)
- Facilitation techniques for cross-functional loop sessions
- Tooling integrations, scripts, automations, and workflows
- Case-patterns that improve repeatability (what works, where it fails)

## What not to contribute here

This repo is not the place to submit your product's loop execution artifacts as primary content.
Use your own product repo or workspace for project-specific loop outputs; link them here only when they teach the framework.

## Contribution principles

- Keep proposals practical and testable
- Explain the "why" and the tradeoffs, not only the "what"
- Prefer reusable patterns over one-off tactics
- Clarify where a technique works and where it does not
- Respect safety, privacy, and compliance constraints

## Suggested format for framework proposals

Use this in issues or PR descriptions:

1. **Framework gap**: What weakness or ambiguity in IDEA are you addressing?
2. **Proposed change**: What method, tool, or technique are you introducing?
3. **Why this helps**: What failure mode does it reduce or what quality does it improve?
4. **How to apply**: Step-by-step usage in a real loop session
5. **Evidence**: Examples, references, or field notes
6. **Boundaries**: Where this should not be used
7. **Adoption signal**: How we would know this improved the framework

## Pull request checklist

- Link a related issue (if applicable)
- Keep scope focused on one framework improvement
- Update docs/examples consistently
- Include before/after wording where possible
- Note any migration impact on existing templates

## Code of collaboration

- Assume positive intent
- Critique ideas, not people
- Keep feedback specific and actionable
