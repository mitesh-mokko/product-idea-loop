# Contributing to Product IDEA Loop

This is a living document and an open system.  
Contributions from PMs, designers, engineers, founders, and non-coders are welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- Open an issue with a new idea, question, or challenge
- Submit a pull request to improve wording, structure, examples, or frameworks
- Add artifacts from real loops (screenshots, links, notes, demos)
- Propose guardrails, metrics, or templates that improve loop quality

## Contribution principles

- Keep changes practical and testable
- Explain the "why," not only the "what"
- Prefer small loops and clear outcomes
- Respect safety, privacy, and compliance constraints

## Suggested format for idea proposals

Use this structure in issues or PR descriptions:

1. **Problem**: What problem are we trying to solve?
2. **Who**: Who is impacted?
3. **Loop Goal (72h max)**: What will we test this loop?
4. **Concrete Output**: Prototype, flow, screen, script, or working slice
5. **Success Signal**: How will we know if this helped?
6. **Next Move**: Ship, iterate, pivot, or stop

## Pull request checklist

- Link related issue (if applicable)
- Keep scope focused (single loop or theme)
- Update docs if behavior or guidance changed
- Add artifact links if you tested in practice

## Code of collaboration

- Assume positive intent
- Critique ideas, not people
- Keep feedback specific and actionable
