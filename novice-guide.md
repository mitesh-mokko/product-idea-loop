# Guidance for Novice Loopers

You do not need 20 years of engineering experience to run a great IDEA loop. You need clear intent, the willingness to look closely, and a few habits that keep the conversation productive.

## Before you start

### Map your context

The single biggest advantage an experienced builder has is not technical skill. It is knowing what they already have. Before starting a loop, write down:

- **What data exists?** Database tables, APIs, existing endpoints, third-party services. Even a one-line description per table saves hours of drift.
- **What does the user feel?** Not what they do — what they feel at each step. Are they anxious? Relieved? Rushed? Grieving? This shapes every decision.
- **What must this NOT feel like?** A clinical form? A cheap checkout flow? A toy? Knowing what to avoid is often clearer than knowing what to aim for.
- **What inspired you?** Share reference links, screenshots, apps you admire. A single reference image communicates more than a paragraph of requirements.

The more context you bring, the fewer wrong turns the conversation takes. Every piece of context you share prevents an assumption you would have to undo later.

### Start with feel, not features

Do not open with "I need a form with 5 fields." Open with "The person using this is stressed and in a hurry. How should this feel?" The features will follow, but they will follow in the right direction.

## During the loop

### Look before you accept

Your most important job is **not accepting the first output**. The tools will produce something functional fast. Functional is not finished. At every step, pause and ask yourself:

- Does this feel right, or just look right?
- Would I show this to someone I respect?
- Read every word of copy out loud. Would you say this to someone's face?
- Does the screen feel ready, or is it still assembling itself?

You do not need to know how to fix what feels off. You just need to notice it and say so. "This feels cold," "that animation is too bouncy," "the photos pop in" — these are enough.

### Push back in feelings, not specifications

You do not need to say "change the spring stiffness from 200 to 80." You can say "that animation feels too celebratory for this moment." The translation from feeling to code is the tool's job. Your job is to protect the intent.

### Deliberate pause points

Build stops into your loop. After each phase, ask:

1. Does the loading state feel anxious or calm?
2. Does the color bleed at every edge, or does the illusion break somewhere?
3. Is anything visually popping in instead of being ready?
4. Does every piece of copy match the emotional tone?
5. Does it feel like one product, or a collection of parts?

These are not code review questions. They are feeling review questions. The tools can fix anything you can name.

### Name what is wrong, not what to do

"The buttons feel harsh next to the pill shape" is better feedback than "change border-radius to 9999px." When you describe the problem in terms of feeling, you leave room for a solution you might not have imagined. When you prescribe the fix, you limit it to what you already know.

### Do not settle for "it works"

Working is the lowest bar. The gap between "it works" and "it feels right" is where products earn trust. A photo that pops in after a delay works. A photo that is already there when you arrive feels like the product was waiting for you. Both are functional. Only one builds confidence.

## The compound effect

Each decision builds on the last. A muted palette makes frosted glass possible. Frosted glass creates depth. Depth makes gentle animations feel intentional. Gentle animations make compassionate copy believable. Pull one thread and the whole tapestry weakens.

This means early decisions matter more than you think. Spend real time on:

- **Color palette** — everything else sits on top of it
- **Animation timing** — it sets the rhythm for the entire experience
- **Shape language** — pick one family (sharp, rounded, pill) and commit

These three choices are your foundation. Get them right and the rest follows. Get them wrong and no amount of polish fixes the disconnect.

## What you do not need

- You do not need to know CSS units (dvh, oklch, rem). You need to know when something overflows or looks wrong on your phone.
- You do not need to know animation curves. You need to know when something feels too fast, too slow, or too bouncy.
- You do not need to know database schemas by heart. You need to know what data you have and share that context upfront.
- You do not need to write code. You need to look at what the code produces and refuse to move on until it feels right.

The technical knowledge accelerates the loop. The intent and taste are the loop.
