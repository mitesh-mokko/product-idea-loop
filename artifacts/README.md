# Artifacts

This folder stores framework-relevant evidence from IDEA loops.

Use it to collect artifacts that strengthen the IDEA method, such as:

- Case notes showing how a loop technique worked or failed
- Before/after examples of framework changes
- Prompt packs, templates, and tool workflows in use
- Public links (threads, demos, writeups) that explain method-level learning

## Suggested structure

Create one markdown file per contribution:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-framework-topic.md`

Example:

- `2026-02-15-assumption-quality-scorecard.md`
