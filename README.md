### A new way to build and ship software in the AI era.

Most teams do not run out of ideas.

They run out of affordable attempts.

For a long time, this made sense. Building software required scarce specialists, long planning cycles, and many handoffs. That old model still works in strong companies with strong teams.

But now AI has changed what is possible. One person can create working software much faster than before. The bottleneck is no longer just coding speed. It is how quickly a team can test assumptions and make better decisions.

The sprint was built to manage scarce builders.

The loop is built to maximize abundant attempts.

## What IDEA means

**IDEA = Insight, Design, Engineering, Analysis.**

In plain terms:

- **Insight**: what problem are we solving and for whom?
- **Design**: what should the experience feel like?
- **Engineering**: how does it actually work?
- **Analysis**: how will we know it worked?

In IDEA, these happen together in the same session, not one after another through long handoffs.

Instinct -> Insight -> Intelligence.

"I" evolves. I mature.

## What a loop is

A loop is one focused round of building and learning.

Most loops should take a few hours.

You can pause at any time.

But every loop should close within 3 days (72 hours).

When a loop closes, capture three things:

1. Something concrete (a prototype, flow, screen, or working slice)
2. What you learned
3. What happens next (ship, iterate, pivot, or stop)

No zombie loops.

## Who can run loops

Anyone working on software ideas can run loops:

PMs, designers, engineers, founders, and cross-functional partners.

Yes, even non-coders can run early loops in sandbox environments with AI.

This does **not** remove expertise.

It removes the "permission bottleneck" at the start.

Experts still matter deeply for quality, scale, and safety.

## Why this helps

In traditional async handoffs, a wrong assumption can hide for weeks.

In a live loop, it can be exposed in hours.

A spec is a hypothesis, not a contract.

If an assumption breaks mid-loop, that is not failure.

That is the loop doing its job.

A loop is a win if it improves the starting conditions of the next loop.

## Guardrails

Fast does not mean reckless.

- Use sandbox first for exploration.
- Apply extra review for high-risk changes (security, privacy, money, legal/compliance, production infrastructure).
- Do not ship what you cannot explain.
- Do not measure value only by hours or ticket count.

In an AI-amplified system, effort is linear.

Leverage is not.

---

## The practical method

Start with one clear goal.

Build something real quickly.

Let insight, design, engineering, and analysis improve each other in real time.

Pause when needed.

Close intentionally.

Start the next loop stronger.

There is always another loop tomorrow.
